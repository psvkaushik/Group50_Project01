,"Docs: doco generated, format not ugly",3,https://github.com/NCSU-Group7-SE2021/slash/tree/main,
,Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation),2,,Most of the codes have descriptions. But there are a few exceptions where description is missing. 
,"Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z",2,,Old version has good tutorials but the new version doesn't.
