,"Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)",3,,
,Number of commits,3,https://github.com/lokesh45/StockPrediction/graphs/code-frequency,
,Number of commits: by different people,3,,Different members committing can be seen in the period of Sep-Oct 2020
,Issues reports: there are many,2,,Most of the issues are documentation related with very few bugs
,Issues are being closed,3,,All issues have been closed
,DOI badge: exists,3,https://zenodo.org/record/4127313,
,"Docs: doco generated, format not ugly",2,,"Although there is enough documentation, it is not sufficient to execute the code easily"
,Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation),0,,None of the codes have description/comments to explain the functionality of the code
,"Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z",2,,Only screenshots provided. No description of what each functionality does
,"Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing",2,https://github.com/lokesh45/StockPrediction,Repo is not extremely attractive. Basic information of the tool is provided with screenshots. 
,"Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.",3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZUhyTCfLUM,
,Use of version control tools,3,,Github is used
,Use of style checkers,3,,"flake8, pylint used"
,Use of code formatters.,3,,"black, prettier used and style checkers"
,Use of syntax checkers.,3,,"flake8, pylint used"
,Use of code coverage,0,,No code coverage used
,Other automated analysis tools,0,,No evidence of automated tools
,Test cases exist,2,,Basic test cases exist
,Test cases are routinely executed,0,,No routine execution to check code
,The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up,1,,"Just a few regulations mentioned, no proper guidelines set to make sure that the people working on the code can adhere to. "
,Issues are discussed before they are closed,1,,"Since the issues are just a few bugs, enhancements, there's no proper comment section to observe"
,Chat channel: exists,0,,No chat channel
,Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.,1,,
,Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files,3,,
,"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)",3,,
,"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)",3,,
,Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base,3,,
,Short release cycles,1,,Code hasn't been worked on since 2020. And only two versions are available.
