"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)",3,
"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)",3,
Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base,3,In the code files multiple contributors to different parts of the project
Short release cycles,,(hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work
